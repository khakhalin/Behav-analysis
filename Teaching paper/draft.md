## Abstract

.

# Introduction

It is common for teaching scientists to stick with their preferred animals models even in the classroom: it does of course feel natural and comfortable, as we know how to handle "our" animals, run the labs, and write animal care protocols. Conversely, it takes a certain effort, even for the experienced biologist, to wade the unknown waters and run a lab on insect olfaction {ref antennogram}, pacemaker ganglia in snails {ref on Helix aspersa parietal ganglia}, or sexual competition in crickets {DeLong 1975} if they have never run these experiments before. With this paper, we want to introduce fellow educators to several simple labs in Xenopus tadpoles that are extremely cheap, easy to run, but rich, flexible, and can be used to ask open-ended scientific questions.

TODO:  Xenopus tadpoles are cool, and used for all sort of stuff. Among other things, here's the list of famous things that were first discovered in tadpoles. And here's a list of types of questions that are usually asked in mammals, but can be asked in tadpoles.

TODO:  At the same time, from the ethical point of view, Xenopus tadpoles are considered a "preferred vertebrate model" {refs}, both because they are amphibians (and thus arguably are less cognitively advanced, compared to birds or mammals), and because they may be considered freely swimming embryos {refs}, rather than adult organisms. Indeed, for the first few weeks that don't even have to eat, living entirely off the egg yolk {Cline's recent paper about developmental stasis}. In this, Xenopus are similar to Zebrafish larvae, but unlike the Zebrafish, at least in the US, Xenopus may be ordered by mail

# Materials and Methods

## Animals

TODO:  how to order, including the product code, and the price.

## Animal Care

TODO:  How to keep. E3 media formula (that it is easier than Steinberg {ref}). How to feed and clean. That if you go for developmental experiments (like microbiome study) and are fine with tadpoles being slightly delayed developmentally, you can also afford to just not feed them for a few weeks {Cline's statis paper again.}

TODO:  About IACUC protocols. Proper way of euthanasia.

TODO:  Say here that care must be taken that students understand that Xenopus tadpoles make bad pets, for three different reasons. One, is that the further they are into metamorphosis, the more demanding Xenopus froglets become both in terms of the quantity of food they get, and the quality of water they live in. They are also a huge commitment, as frogs live for 30 years in captivity {ref}, and finally, are considered an invasive species, and are illegal to keep in many countries and US states (actual list of states) {refs}.

## Setup

TODO: Explain why for visual stimulation a simple monitor won't do, but one should either use an old CRT monitor, a projectin table, or an Ipad.

TODO: Describe the projection table. (There will be a figure here as well)

TODO: Vessels to hold tadpoles

TODO: Acoustic stimulation part (speakers, struts, sticky wax).

> List of stuff to mention: 

* Pale = unhealthy {ref}
* Swimming in very tight circles = potential seizures, don't use {Bell}
* Tadpoles tend to go to the light, so it's better to either dim the lights, or try to keep them balanced. Also, for all experiments in which the direction of swimming is used as a read-out variable, make sure to alternate directions.
* Tend to go on the deeper end when water is uneven
* For visual experiments, make sure the light is not too strong to avoid blinding tadpoles via retinal bleaching {Khakhalin 2014?}
* Try not to overshadow them (bend over the tank), as they have a strong escape response, followed by behavioral habituation

TODO: Programs (including a link to github that is currently in development, but will contain all stimulation files, analysis files, sample data etc.: https://github.com/khakhalin/Xenopus-Behavior)

# Results

## Pre-pulse inhibition

TODO: Summarize the protocol, show sample data.

## Habituation

TODO: 

## Optomotor Response

TODO: 

## Collision avoiance

TODO: 

## Multisensory integration

TODO: 

## Ways to make the labs open

TODO: Add any sort of water-soluble chemical chronically or acutely; raise in an altered sensory environment. Examples with ethanol.

# Discussion

TODO: Again reinstate that investments are truly minimal.

We would like to also briefly mention that Xenopus embryos and tadpoles may be useful for countless other labs in animal behavior, neuroscience, and physiology. To name a few, they can replace adult vertebrates in classic experiments in heart rate modulation, as it is rather easy to open the tadpole from the ventral side {ref dissection paper or Kara's video}, after fully submerging it in solution of MS-222 {ref} and pinning it down to a sylgard block (NAME) with insect pins (NAME) {ref}. The heart can then be perfused from the outside with solutions containing caffeine, acetylcholine, or even just higher concentration of potassium, obviously altering the heart rate. Next, in upper-college neuroscience labs, it may be possible to use suction electrodes {ref crayfish electrodes + that fancy chart on electrode manufacturing} to record summary spiking activity from tadpole optic nerves, in response to visual stimulation (Khakhalin 2014), and fictive swimming in the spinal cord after NMDA application {ref}.

Ordering freshly fertilized Xenopus eggs from Nasco (product id XXX), and cleaning them two times over the weekend (as of fall 2019, Nasco facility typically breeds dogs on Thursdays, which means that the eggs arrive on Fridays) opens an opportunity for all kinds of classical developmental experiments, such as exposing the eggs to teratogens, or UV {ref}. Finally, tadpoles can live without food for NNN weeks, relying solely on their yolk supplies {ref recent Cline}, which means that each developing embryo can easily be put in a separate Petri dish, making it possible to combine developmental studies and microbiological or metagenomic studies {ref?}. Overall, we believe that Xenopus tadpoles are currently somewhat underappreciated as a teaching tool, and encourage teaching professors from other colleges give them a try!
