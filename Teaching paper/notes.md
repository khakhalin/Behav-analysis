We would like to also briefly mention that Xenopus embryos and tadpoles may be useful for countless other labs in animal behavior, neuroscience, and physiology. To name a few, they can replace adult vertebrates in classic experiments in heart rate modulation, as it is rather easy to open the tadpole from the ventral side {ref dissection paper or Kara's video}, after fully submerging it in solution of MS-222 {ref} and pinning it down to a sylgard block (NAME) with insect pins (NAME) {ref}. The heart can then be perfused from the outside with solutions containing caffeine, acetylcholine, or even just higher concentration of potassium, obviously altering the heart rate. Next, in upper-college neuroscience labs, it may be possible to use suction electrodes {ref crayfish electrodes + that fancy chart on electrode manufacturing} to record summary spiking activity from tadpole optic nerves, in response to visual stimulation (Khakhalin 2014), and fictive swimming in the spinal cord after NMDA application {ref}.

Ordering freshly fertilized Xenopus eggs from Nasco (product id XXX), and cleaning them two times over the weekend (as of fall 2019, Nasco facility typically breeds dogs on Thursdays, which means that the eggs arrive on Fridays) opens an opportunity for all kinds of classical developmental experiments, such as exposing the eggs to teratogens, or UV {ref}. Finally, tadpoles can live without food for NNN weeks, relying solely on their yolk supplies {ref recent Cline}, which means that each developing embryo can easily be put in a separate Petri dish, making it possible to combine developmental studies and microbiological or metagenomic studies {ref?}. Overall, we believe that Xenopus tadpoles are currently somewhat underappreciated as a teaching tool, and encourage teaching professors from other colleges give them a try!
